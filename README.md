# Q/A Assignment
1. You train Logistic Regression with a certain set of features and learn weights $w_0$, $w_1$ till $w_n$.
Feature $n$ gets weight $w_n$ at the end of training. Say you now create a new dataset where you duplicate feature $n$ into feature $(n+1)$ and retrain a new model. Suppose this new model weights are $w_{new_0}$, $w_{new_1}$ till $w_{new_n}$, $w_{new_{n+1}}$. What is the likely relationship between $w_{new_0}$, $w_{new_1}$ , $w_{new_n}$,  and $w_{new_{n+1}}$?
